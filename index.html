      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Currently pursuing <a href="#"title="A B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is a four-year undergraduate program focused on the design, development, and implementation of computer software and hardware. It combines theoretical knowledge with practical skills in areas like programming, algorithms, data structures, and more.">B.Tech in Computer Science</a> with a passion for building efficient and scalable solutions. Skilled in <a href="#" title="Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, from designing the user interface (front-end) to managing the server-side logic and databases (back-end). Essentially, it's about bringing websites and web applications to life through coding and other technical processes. ">Web Development</a>, <a href="#" title="DSA, or Data Structures and Algorithms, is a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on how to efficiently store and organize data (data structures) and how to solve problems using a step-by-step process (algorithms). Mastering DSA is crucial for optimizing code performance and building scalable applications.">Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</a>, and <a href="#" title="Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. It encompasses a systematic and structured approach to building high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software systems. Essentially, it's about applying engineering principles to the creation of software, rather than treating it as solely an art or a craft.">Software Engineering</a>. <br>
        Proficient in <a href="#" title="HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to structure web pages and their content. It provides the framework for displaying text, images, and other multimedia elements within a web browser. Essentially, it's the foundation upon which websites are built.">HTML</a>, <a href="#" title="Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.">CSS</a>, <a href="#" title="JavaScript (JS) is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites, allowing for features like animations, form validation, and real-time updates. It's also used for server-side development with Node.js, mobile app development with frameworks like React Native, and even game development with libraries like Phaser">JavaScript</a>, <a href="#" title="Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways. SCons for build control. Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing.">Python</a>, <a href="#" title="C and C++ are both programming languages, but C++ is an extension of C. C is a procedural language, while C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. C++ includes features not found in C, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, C++ offers features like function overloading, references, and exception handling, which are absent in C.">C/C++</a>, and <a href="#" title="MySQL is primarily used as a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store, manage, and retrieve data for various applications. It's widely used in web applications, content management systems, and embedded systems. Its open-source nature, reliability, and scalability make it a popular choice for both small and large-scale deployments. ">MySQL</a> to build dynamic web applications.
